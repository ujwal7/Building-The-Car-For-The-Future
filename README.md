# Building-The-Car-For-The-Future
<h2> Introduction</h2>
The automobile sector is fiercely competitive. Automobile manufacturers are continually tweaking their procedures to boost fuel economy in response to rising gasoline prices and finicky consumers. But what if you could have a realistic estimator for a car's mpg based on certain known vehicle specifications? Then you may beat a competitor in the market by having a more desired car that is also more efficient and winning a sizable market share.<br>
In this project, we will use prediction software using a dataset of cars. The program and data used are simple to comprehend. We'll go through them in the data analysis portion. We'll look at missing values and outliers before training the linear regression model. Then follows the feature engineering process, in which I will check the skewness of the distributions of each numerical variable. During the data preparation stage, I will divide the data into training and test sets to prepare it for machine learning models. Standardization is a critical phrase for avoiding prejudice against features with higher values relative to others and bringing features into the same space. In the modeling section, we will use a linear regression model.
<h2>Conclusion</h2><br>
• The weight of a vehicle influences how much gasoline it consumes. The more energy 
required to move a vehicle, the heavier it is. Extra weight also raises a vehicle's rolling 
resistance, which is a force that opposes forward motion created by the wheels as they 
roll over the road. As a result, losing weight is a particularly efficient technique to reduce 
a vehicle's fuel usage. Strict regulations and consumer demand are already having an 
impact. Lighter materials, such as aluminum and sophisticated composites, are being used 
by automakers to create lighter-weight automobiles. Automobile manufacturers are also 
modifying their designs to save weight. Because less power is required to drive a lighter 
vehicle, these advancements are allowing for the use of smaller engines with no loss of 
performance. If we take this weight aspect into account and replace heavy parts with 
lighter ones while assuring no performance loss, the firm may continue to manufacture
automobiles with high MPG.<br>
• The number of cylinders also has a significant role in poorer MPG. The more cylinders 
there are in the automobile, the lower the MPG. Companies can employ CDS, which 
stands for cylinder deactivation systems, to address this issue. When only a little quantity 
of engine power is required, a CDS in a 6- or 8-cylinder engine shuts off half of the 
cylinders. This occurs whether driving on the highway or downhill. A CDS can reduce 
fuel usage by 4 to 10%, saving you money and lowering your environmental effect.<br>
• Weight, Horsepower, Acceleration, and Cylinders all have an inverse relationship with 
MPG. That is, as we have seen in the modeling and EDA stages, as these factors increase, 
the value of MPG decreases.<br>
• The MPG is proportionate to the model year. MPG value increases as the Model Year 
value increases. It basically means that as time goes on, new technology will emerge, and 
we will eventually find a way to build efficient MPG cars.<br>
